# Ultralight MIDI Player Snake Game MOD
This is my snake game mod of Ultralight MIDI Player.

Instead of running tetris game at april fools, I let UMP run snake game instead! 

Note that I will not provide any complete jar files here. Do not ask my for it, I won't! 

This repository will only contain code that are written 100% by myself and you need to replace the class files in the jar file needed for the game ON YOUR OWN! 

In addition, please make sure you've carefully check every single line of code in the class file that you are about to replace. 

This is project certainly not a malware but how could you be sure I'm not lieing to you until you've checked everything yourself? Do not trust anyone on the internet, including me!!! 

## Usage: 
Download the latest UMP jar from [offcial website](https://pipiraworld.web.fc2.com/ump/en.html). 

Open the jar with your favorite archive software. 

Replace the following files in the archive with my custom files provided in releases. 

- MIDIPlayer.jar\game.mid
- MIDIPlayer.jar\pipira\MIDIPlayer\render\renderer\BlockGameRenderer.class
- MIDIPlayer.jar\pipira\MIDIPlayer\app\dialogs\BlockGameControlsDialog.class

Tip: Change this line in MIDIPlayer.jar\pipira\MIDIPlayer\app\AprilChecker.class to make the April Features always active no matter what.
