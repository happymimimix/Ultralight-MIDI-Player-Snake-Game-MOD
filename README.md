# Ultralight MIDI Player Snake Game MOD
This is my snake game mod of Ultralight MIDI Player.
Instead of running tetris game at april fools, I let UMP run snake game instead! 

## Usage: 
Download the latest UMP jar from offcial website. 

Open the jar with your favorite archive software. 

Replace the following files in the archive with my custom files provided in attachments. 

- MIDIPlayer.jar\game.mid
- MIDIPlayer.jar\pipira\MIDIPlayer\render\renderer\BlockGameRenderer.class
- MIDIPlayer.jar\pipira\MIDIPlayer\app\dialogs\BlockGameControlsDialog.class

Enjoy!
