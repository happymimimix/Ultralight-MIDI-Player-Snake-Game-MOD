# Ultralight MIDI Player Snake Game MOD
This is my snake game mod of Ultralight MIDI Player.

Instead of running tetris game at april fools, I let UMP run snake game instead! 

## Usage: 
Download the latest UMP jar from offcial website. https://pipiraworld.web.fc2.com/ump/en.html

Open the jar with your favorite archive software. 

Replace the following files in the archive with my custom files provided in releases. 

- MIDIPlayer.jar\game.mid
- MIDIPlayer.jar\pipira\MIDIPlayer\render\renderer\BlockGameRenderer.class
- MIDIPlayer.jar\pipira\MIDIPlayer\app\dialogs\BlockGameControlsDialog.class

Enjoy!

Tip: Change this line in MIDIPlayer.jar\pipira\MIDIPlayer\app\AprilChecker.class to make the April Features always active no matter what.
